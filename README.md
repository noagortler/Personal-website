# Personal Portfolio Website
## Overview
This project is a responsive personal portfolio website built using **HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript**. The goal of the assignment was to apply JavaScript concepts to an existing HTML/CSS project in a way that enhances usability and interactivity.
The site showcases basic information about me and my experience, while incorporating simple but effective JavaScript-driven features.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML** – page structure and content  
- **CSS** – custom styling, layout, and responsive design  
- **Bootstrap 5** – layout utilities and responsive helpers  
- **JavaScript** – interactivity and UI behavior

## JS Features
### Dark / Light Mode Toggle
- Users can switch between dark and light themes using a toggle in the sidebar.
- JavaScript listens for changes on a checkbox input and adds or removes a CSS class on the `<body>` element.
- Theme changes background colors, text colors, and card styling.
### Section Navigation with Active Highlight
- A section navigation menu allows users to jump to different sections of the page.
- Clicking a section link smoothly scrolls to the selected section.
- The currently visible section is highlighted in the navigation.
### Back to Top Button
- A “Back to Top” button appears once the user scrolls 400px down the page.
- Clicking the button smoothly scrolls the page back to the top.
- Button visibility is controlled using JavaScript and CSS classes.

## JavaScript Focus
The JavaScript in this project was intentionally kept simple, focusing on:
- `querySelector` and `getElementById`
- `addEventListener`
- conditionals (`if / else`)
- class manipulation (`classList.add` / `classList.remove`)
- timing logic (`setTimeout`)
- scroll position detection using `getBoundingClientRect()`

## Challenges and Learning Outcomes
- JavaScript proved more challenging than HTML and CSS due to its logical structure.
- Debugging interactive behaviors helped strengthen my understanding of how JavaScript responds to user actions and browser events.
- This project improved my confidence in combining HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create interactive user experiences.

## Future Improvements
- Expand project sections adding in my projects
- Improve colour contrast for visibility
- Continue to implement simple and impactful JavaScript
